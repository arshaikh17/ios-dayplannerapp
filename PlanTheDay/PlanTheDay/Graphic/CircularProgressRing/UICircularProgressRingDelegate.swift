 This is the protocol declaration for the UICircularProgressRingView delegate property
 
 ## Important ##
 When progress is done updating via UICircularProgressRingView.setValue(_:), the
 finishedUpdatingProgress(forRing: UICircularProgressRingView) will be called.
 
 The ring will be passed to the delegate in order to keep
 track of multiple ring updates if needed.

     ## Important:
     This is a very hot method and may be called hundreds of times per second during animations. As such make sure to only
     do very simple and non-intensive work in this method. Do any work that takes time will considerably slow down your application.
